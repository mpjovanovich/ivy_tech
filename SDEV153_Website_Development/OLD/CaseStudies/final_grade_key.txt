Content
(10) Page content is sparse.
(5) Images file sizes should be < 100KB unless it's for a gallery. If so, there should be a small sized preview image with a link to the full-size image. Large images load very slowly on slow connections.
(2) Incomplete sentences - punctuation missing from home page.
(1) email links should use mailto.

Design
(5) Style is sparse, and looks similar to the default browser implementation for many elements.
(1) Main navigation links should offer visual feedback on hover. This helps users quickly identify their function.
(2) Navigation should not have bullet points, even if using a list. Bulleted items set a different expectation (not one of navigation) for the user.
(1) Hero image should be centered.
(2) There should be padding between the browser border and page content.
(5) Bullets in nav overlap text when resizing window.
(1) Lines/items need spaced further apart; difficult to read.
(2) Difficult to read text; needs more foreground-background contrast.

Mobile Friendly
(5) Some elements scroll off to the right in small viewport.
Missing CSS media queries for mobile styling.

SEO best practice
(2) Page titles not provided.
(1) Page titles should be different throughout site.
(2) Description meta element not provided.
(2) Alt text for media should be accurate and descriptive.

FORMS
(2) Form inputs should have a corresponding label element.
(2) No action attribute on form.
(2) Forms that are submitted to server for processing should use method=post.
(1) Use the  type=email attribute for email inputs. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email



Nice mailto link.
Good use of visual hover cues on nav links.
Good use of required attribute.

TODO:

Force required fields in form.
Better split for CSS and design rubric sections.
Remove table requirement.
