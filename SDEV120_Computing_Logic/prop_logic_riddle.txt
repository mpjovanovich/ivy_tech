There is a car in only one of the boxes. We can state that as:

A = car is in Box1
B = car is in Box2
C = car is in Box3

A IFF !B AND !C
B IFF !A AND !C
C IFF !A AND !B

(IFF means contrapositives are true too - if !B AND !C then A.)

Given the following statements from the boxes..
Box1 = A
Box2 = !B
Box3 = !A

One box is telling the truth, and the other two are lying, therefore only one of the following scenarios is valid:

Hypothesis1 = If Box1 Then !Box2 AND !Box3
Hypothesis2 = If Box2 Then !Box1 AND !Box3
Hypothesis3 = If Box3 Then !Box1 AND !Box2

(We could technically expand these expressions...)
Hypothesis1 IFF !Hypothesis2 AND !Hypothesis3
Hypothesis2 IFF !Hypothesis1 AND !Hypothesis3
Hypothesis3 IFF !Hypothesis1 AND !Hypothesis2

A hypothesis is invalid (False) if it reaches the state : If [True] then [False]. 

SOLUTION
______________________________

Hypothesis1 = If Box1 Then !Box2 AND !Box3: 
If A Then B AND A
B AND A is a contradiction because "A IFF !B AND !C", therefore Hypothesis1 is invalid - we cannot assume that it contains any true statements.

Hypothesis2 = If Box2 Then !Box1 AND !Box3: 
If !B Then !A AND A
!A AND A is a contradiction, therefore Hypothesis2 is invalid - we cannot assume that it contains any true statements.

Because Hypothesis3 IFF !Hypothesis1 AND !Hypothesis2 we now know Hypothesis3 must be valid, but let's check anyway:

Hypothesis3 = If Box3 Then !Box1 AND !Box2: 
If !A Then !A AND B
There are no contradictions, so we can use the statements to figure out which box has the car! So - which box has it?
