There is a car in only one of the boxes. We can state that as:

A = car is in Box1
B = car is in Box2
C = car is in Box3

A IFF !B AND !C
B IFF !A AND !C
C IFF !A AND !B

(IFF means contrapositives are true too - if !B AND !C then A.)

Given the following statements from the boxes..
Box1 = A
Box2 = !B
Box3 = !A

One box is telling the truth, and the other two are lying, therefore only one of the following scenarios is valid:

Hypothesis1: Box1 AND !Box2 AND !Box3
Hypothesis2: Box2 AND !Box1 AND !Box3
Hypothesis3: Box3 AND !Box1 AND !Box2

A hypothesis is invalid if it reaches the state : If [True] then [False]. 

SOLUTION
______________________________

Hypothesis1 = Box1 AND !Box2 AND !Box3: 
A AND B AND A
A AND B = False because of "A IFF !B AND !C", therefore Hypothesis1 is not satisfiable.
Therefore Hypothesis1 is invalid - we cannot use those statements.

Hypothesis2 = Box2 AND !Box1 AND !Box3: 
!B AND !A AND A
!A AND A is a contradiction, therefore Hypothesis1 is not satisfiable.
Therefore Hypothesis2 is invalid - we cannot use those statements.

We now know Hypothesis3 must be valid, but let's check anyway:

Hypothesis3 = Box3 AND !Box1 AND !Box2: 
!A AND !A AND B
There are no contradictions, so we can use the statements to figure out which box has the car!
