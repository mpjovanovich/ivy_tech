Prompt the user to enter
	employee name
	position ("management" or "non-management"),
	hours worked for the week

Continue to prompt until the user types "done".

Print a report on the data with three sections containing:
	1) Name, hours worked, and weekly pay for each employee.
	2) Employee count, aggregated into two categories - one figure for management and another for non-management.
	3) Average hours worked, aggregated into two categories - one figure for management  and another for non-management.
	
The standard pay rate for management is $22/hr.
The standard pay rate for floor non-management is $18/hr.
Any hours worked exceeding 40 hours are at a modified pay rate of 1.5 times standard pay (overtime pays time and a half).
